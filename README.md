# IASE 2023 Conference Presentation

**Abstract:**

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that often requires mastering a set of skills and concepts associated with statistics, computer science, mathematics, and other domains. Introduction to Data Science (IDS) courses are being offered by many different departments either as a mandatory or an elective course. Because of the foundational nature of IDS courses to develop students’ understanding of data science, it is important for data science education community to be aware of students’ prior conceptions and potential learning difficulties. To that end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 IDS instructors to study on students’ difficulties and prior conceptions as reported by IDS instructors. Additionally, we collected IDS syllabi from participants and examined as supporting evidence. Content analysis was used to analyze the data.

We found that IDS instructors reported that students’ prior knowledge and difficulties tend to differ based on their background. For example, students having coding experience generally perform better in programming, while others have difficulties in grasping the basics of coding, how to use different packages, and data wrangling. For prior conceptions, they stated that some students tend to believe that gaining a set of good programming skills is solely needed to become a data scientist which often leads to oversimplifying tasks and undervalue developing other important skills such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and presenting data. An implication of this work is that IDS courses can be approved by attending to the difficulties students experience and the prior conceptions students bring with them to such courses. This study invites data science education researchers to conduct future research with data science students to understand the dimensionality of student learning and prior conceptions to improve capacity in data science (education).
